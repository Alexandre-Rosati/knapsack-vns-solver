This development consist to resolve a knapsack problem with the variable neighborhood search algorithm. This project was developed as part of my masterâ€™s degree at the university of Mons in Belgium.

The environment of development was NodeJS v8.12.0 and TypeScript v3.9.7 :

* [How to install NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs)
* [How to install Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)

To retrieve the deposit and generate the dependencies :

```
git clone https://github.com/Alexandre-Rosati/knapsack-vns-solver.git
cd knapsack-vns-solver/
npm install
```
## Usage

To use the solver, you just have to start the `npm run execute` script. A pre-build is already in the deposit.

The project was developed with Typescript so in case you want to change the default values, you can re-transpile the code with the command: `npm run make`.
